The place where you found this file is known as the ROOT of your site.  It's the place where everything begins.  The very first file you should create here is called index.html. You can use any text client such as Notepad, SublimeText, TextWrangler, etc. to edit html files.  Use whatever feels comfortable, so long as itâ€™s not Word =)
